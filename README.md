# @gonkagate/claude-code

Set up Claude Code to use GonkaGate in one `npx` command.

This CLI installer is for developers who already have local `Claude Code` and want to use it with GonkaGate, the gateway to Gonka Network, without editing shell profiles, exporting long env var blocks, or writing `.env` files by hand.

Under the hood it configures Claude Code to use GonkaGate's Anthropic-compatible endpoint at `https://api.gonkagate.com`.

It does not install `Claude Code` itself. It configures an existing local Claude Code install.

## Quick Start

```bash
npx @gonkagate/claude-code
```

## See It In Action

From API key to a working Claude Code setup in one short walkthrough:

Need an API key first? [Create one on GonkaGate](https://gonkagate.com/en).

You will be asked for:

- your GonkaGate API key (`gp-...`) in a hidden interactive prompt
- a model from the supported GonkaGate list
- setup scope: `user` or `local`

If you choose `local` scope and `.claude/settings.local.json` is already tracked by git, the installer offers to stop tracking that file and continue, or switch to `user` scope instead.

You need:

- local `Claude Code`
- Node.js 18+
- a GonkaGate API key

## Supported Model

Current public Claude Code model in the curated registry:

- `qwen3-235b` -> `qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-instruct-2507-fp8`

## What It Does

The tool writes Claude Code settings so you can keep running `claude` normally afterward.

By default it writes to:

- `~/.claude/settings.json`

If you choose local scope, it writes to:

- `.claude/settings.local.json`

It also:

- preserves unrelated Claude Code settings
- creates a backup before overwriting an existing settings file
- writes settings files with owner-only permissions
- writes backup files with owner-only permissions
- adds `.claude/settings.local.json` and local backup files to `.git/info/exclude` for local setup inside a git repo
- offers to stop tracking `.claude/settings.local.json` before local setup writes secrets into a file that was already tracked by git
- refuses local setup if the target path traverses a symlinked path component, or if `.claude` / the local settings file is a symlink

## Fixed GonkaGate Setup

These parts are intentionally fixed:

- Base URL: `https://api.gonkagate.com`
- Auth variable: `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`
- Model choice: only from the curated supported list

This tool does not ask for a custom base URL and does not accept arbitrary custom model IDs.

The selected model is written into all Claude Code model env vars used by this setup flow.

## Verify

After setup:

1. If Claude Code was previously logged directly into Anthropic, run `claude auth logout`
2. Start Claude Code normally with `claude`
3. Run `/status`
4. Confirm the active gateway is `https://api.gonkagate.com`

## What This Tool Does Not Do

- It does not configure `claude.ai`
- It does not install `Claude Code` itself
- It does not edit `.zshrc`, `.bashrc`, PowerShell profiles, or other shell startup files
- It does not write `.env` files
- It does not support arbitrary custom model IDs
- It does not support custom base URL overrides
